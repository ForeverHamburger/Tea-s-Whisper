        id="TrustAllX509TrustManager"

        priority="6"
        summary="Insecure TLS/SSL trust manager"
        explanation="This check looks for X509TrustManager implementations whose `checkServerTrusted` or `checkClientTrusted` methods do nothing (thus trusting any certificate chain) which could result in insecure network traffic caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers."
